## What is this?
This is a Core for Mindustry Expandsion. Indeed, I have put it into one package, but there is a reason why I keep the data separate.
This mod contains the system and data for the Mindustry Expansion Mod, everything here is data that was created separately so as not to mix it up and make work easier.

## Why is this made separately?
This is due to many factors, I separated this as the first reason to create a backup, because the possibility of corrupted files in the main Mod is greater. And here are other reasons:
- Unexpected errors that can hinder major Mod developers.
- Makes it easier for me to see the content I create.
- Makes it easier to search and sort system files.
- Always comes out in Beta or Release form.

## Who is the real original creator?
[Artemwing](https://github.com/zuoranartemwing), he is the original owner, but I created this because apparently I was having a bit of trouble with mixed code.
Because there are different code languages, namely JSON and HJSON, which makes files mixed up, as well as complicated file naming, so I have difficulty.
